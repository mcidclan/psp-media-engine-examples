## PSP Media Engine Samples / Examples

This repository gathers links to recent samples and code examples related to the PSP Media Engine.
These samples are the result of personal exploration, trial and error, some hardware-level investigation, and occasional reverse engineering when needed. The approach has been mostly empirical, driven by experimentation and curiosity.

The goal is to share findings and references that might be useful to others interested in working with the PSP's Media Engine.
